# What we have been using this whole time, are functions, like print, len, str, int, etc. 
# to make a function we use def to define a function 

# adds two numbers together 
def add():
    print(5 + 5) 
    # if you try to run this, it won't work, since this is the Definition of the function ONLY, we need to call it like we call everything else

add()
# ^^ calling it 


# we can have functions that take arguments 

def add(num1, num2):
    print(num1 + num2)
